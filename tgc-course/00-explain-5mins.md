# Explaining the Gospel: A Challenge

If dealing with modern day atheists who are completely obsolete of the Bible, things are hard. Do not expect at all that you can convery all the content of the gospel in five minutes. Best chance is to provide bible study opportunities and other kinds of exposures to the Bible for them.

# Gospel Fluency notes:
## Ch. 1 Everyone is an Unbeliever
- "We still have places in our lives where we don't believe God, don't trust his word, don't believe what he accomplished in Christ is enough to deal with our past, present, and future."
- "Sanctification is moving from unbelief in Jesus toi belief in him in the everyday stuff of life"
## Ch. 2 Give Them Jesus
- "I have met too many people who love their Bibles yet have no genuine relationship with Jesus Christ. They don't really know him. They don't really love him. They don't really worship him. Instead, they worship their Bibles. They are not growing up into maturity because they are not growing up into Christ."
- "The motive for abstinence is not better sex in the future", "the reason we wait to have sex until we are married is because of Jesus's faithfulness to us. We are his bride, and we live to tell the story of his love for us."
- "If [God] didn't hold back his only Son, you can be certain he will give you every other good gift that you need as well."
